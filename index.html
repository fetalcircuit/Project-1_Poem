<h1>Too Distracted by Cookies</h1>
<h2>Narrative Poem by Lina Park</h2>

<p>The ticking of the clock was a dreary and dreadful sound.
	<br>“Tick! Tock! Tick! Tock!” it shrieked at me with its sharp hands ablaze.
	<br>It taunted my shackled fate of imprisonment at the hands of the corporate hound.
	<br>The meeting room seemed particularly drab today as voices became a jumbled haze.


<br>There was only one reason for my lack of focus and I can’t say I’m proud of it, alright?
	<br>But the thoughts of ooey gooey filling encased by a golden brown cocoon ravished my mind.
	<br>It was almost as if I could taste the chocolate chips melting against my tastebuds with every bite.
	<br>And knowing last night’s batch of cookies were sitting on my kitchen counter was like torture defined.
