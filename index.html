<h1>Too Distracted by Cookies</h1>
<h2>Narrative Poem by Lina Park</h2>
<p>The ticking of the clock was a dreary and dreadful sound.
“Tick! Tock! Tick! Tock!” it shrieked at me with its sharp hands ablaze.
It taunted my shackled fate of imprisonment at the hands of the corporate hound.
The meeting room seemed particularly drab today as voices became a jumbled haze. </p>

<p2>There was only one reason for my lack of focus and I can’t say I’m proud of it, alright?
But the thoughts of ooey gooey filling encased by a golden brown cocoon ravished my mind.
It was almost as if I could taste the chocolate chips melting against my tastebuds with every bite.
And knowing last night’s batch of cookies were sitting on my kitchen counter was like torture defined.
